            This page contains IGN's walkthrough for Fog of War in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this mission, you'll push forward with your squad while taking out enemies in a close 
            quarters environment. You'll have to locate various weapon stashes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Follow your squadmate upstairs to the RC planes. You'll use these to remotely destroy enemy 
            vehicles. They can be a little wonky to control, but you won't need to be doing any elaborate flying.
        </p>
        <p>
            Follow the other planes and crash directly into the large helicopter on the right. Once you do that, 
            you'll be able to follow your team below. Wait for the orders and then cross the path that leads up a hill to the enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you reach the top, stick to the right side and grab some better weapons if you see any. Use cover to safely take out 
            the enemies nearby. Don't forget, you have molotovs as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            You'll come to another set of enemies, but this time, you'll be able to use your RC planes to help take them out. Stick to 
            the right path, using the buildings for cover. Remember, you can mount your weapon to peek around a corner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try to fly your planes into vehicles for some added effect. Plus, it looks cool. As you push your way forward, be careful not 
            to run out in the open without checking to see if enemies are nearby. They can kill you instantly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember to stick to the right side as you make your way forward. You'll eventually come to the first armory. Head inside and 
            load up.
        </p>
        <img src = "Assets/Picture18.jpg" alt = "Call of Duty" class="center">
        <p>
            After you're all geared up, head out the other door to meet your squad outside. A squadmate will crash a truck into the gate to 
            allow you to get though.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this point, you'll come to a long, narrow stretch, where a helicopter will be waiting. Use your RC plane to destroy it. From here, 
            make your way forward, while carefully taking out the enemies ahead. You'll want to eliminate everyone you can, before moving forward.
        </p>
        <img src = "Assets/Picture19.jpg" alt = "Call of Duty" class="center">
        <p>
            Keep weaving in and out of the buildings to stay safe, while pushing forward. Don't forget to use molotovs if you need to.
        </p>
        <p>
            After that, you'll come to a large area with a hanger at the far end. Again, stick to the right side, using the trucks and containers 
            for cover. Take out the enemy in the tower on the right.
        </p>
        <p>
            Peek out and neutralize anyone you see. Remember, you can mount your weapon for added stability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the large truck on the right side as cover to eliminate everyone in your path. Your goal is to make it inside the hangar. Also, 
            watch out for the enemy that will be shooting RPGs at you. He's standing on some crates in front of the hangar.
        </p>

        <p>
            Move forward while sticking to the right and use the crates in front of the hangar as cover. Be aware of a couple stragglers that 
            could still be alive inside.
        </p>

        <h1>Hanger</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Once everyone is taken out, your squad will rush inside, towards the next armory at the back. You won't be able to just bust through 
            the door, so instead, you'll need to boost a squadmate up to the roof of the armory so he can pull you up. At the top, open the hatch 
            and throw a molotov inside.
        </p>
        <p>
            Be careful to cover the left and right sides of the armory, just in case. When you drop down, grab some weapons and ammo and prepare 
            for one last fight.
        </p>
        <p>
            Head back to the front of the hangar, making sure to stick to cover to be safe. Here, you'll be able to pick off enemies as they approach. 
            Eventually, tanks will appear, which you are no match for.
        </p>

            Luckily, you've got friends in the sky to help. At this point, the perspective will shift and you'll be controlling a pilot in the sky who 
            will provide air support. Since you're using thermal vision, it can be kind of tough to get your bearings, but just be aware that the hangar 
            is on your left.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternate between the chain gun and rockets to eliminate everything in your path. Focus on the large tanks first and then move on to the smaller 
            trucks and enemies on foot.
        </p>
        <p>
            There will also be an enemy shooting rockets at you, so make sure you get rid of him as soon as you can. You can withstand some damage, so it's 
            not the end of the world if you get hit.
        </p>
        <img src = "Assets/Picture22.jpg" alt = "Call of Duty" class="center">

            After you've dealt enough damage, the mission will end and you'll be ready to move on to the next one.
