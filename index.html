            Prepare to go dark -- Modern Warfare is back! Developed by Infinity Ward, Call of Duty: Modern 
            Warfare puts you in the role of highly-skilled Tier One operators in an incredibly raw and gritty 
            narrative affecting the global balance of power. The new Modern Warfare delivers an emotionally 
            charged and intense campaign that shines a light on the changing nature of modern war.<br>

            Expect a single-player experience that is edgy, culturally relevant, and thought-provoking. 
            Players will fight alongside a diverse cast of international special forces and freedom fighters 
            working within the grey area of their rules of engagement, in a number of heart-pounding covert 
            operations set throughout iconic European cities and into the volatile expanses of the Middle East. 
            Missions include close-quarter, stealth operations and long-range combat that puts tactical 
            decision-making to the ultimate test.<br>
