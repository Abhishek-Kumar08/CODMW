        <hr>
        <p>
            This page contains IGN's walkthrough for Fog of War in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this mission, you'll be working with Farah, disguised as a civilian, as you make your way 
            through the terrorist-filled streets. This is a callback to the All Ghillied Up mission from 
            Call of Duty 4.
        </p>

            After you talk with Farah and grab your disguise and weapons, follow her out the door. Don't 
            attack anyone and stick close to her. Eventually, you'll come to a section that requires you 
            to separate for a short while. Here, you'll need to head to the left to pick up a cinderblock 
            from the pile.
        </p>
        <p>
            Holding it will allow you to pass through the path where the two guards and the dog are standing.
        </p>
        <img src = "Assets/Picture11.jpg" alt = "Call of Duty" class="center">
        <p>
            Make your way out the other side and you'll see Farah run by. She tells you to go left, so follow 
            her instructions. Here, she'll bust through the nearby door and take out the guard ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enter the building to the left and eliminate the guard assaulting the woman. After that, continue 
            following Farah through the door that leads outside. You'll come to a spot with multiple enemies 
            here. What you need to do is enter the building on your right (the one with the colored crates 
            stacked up by the garage door) and search the front of the vehicle inside to get a makeshift 
            silencer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you grab it, head along the right side of the truck by the enemies and follow Farah's orders 
            to take them out quietly.
        </p>
        <img src = "Assets/Picture12.jpg" alt = "Call of Duty" class="center">
        <p>
            Enter the building and use the hole in the wall to eliminate the guards in the next room. Grab the 
            throwing knife on the table and continue onward.
        </p>
        <p>
            Make your way alongside the group of people outside and continue following Farah into a building and 
            up a ladder. When you reach the top, you'll have a new objective: Plant explosives on the two 
            helicopters.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>Plant Explosives on the Helicopters</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Head to the rightmost one first. To do so, drop down to the street and you'll find a room below the 
            helicopter, next to another room with a guard in front of a door. You'll notice a tiny space where 
            you can see into the next hall, so use that to take out the enemy.
        </p>
        <img src = "Assets/Picture13.jpg" alt = "Call of Duty" class="center">
        <p>
            After that, follow the path and grab another cinderblock nearby so you can pass by the guards. Drop it 
            and climb up the ladder behind them.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you reach the top, go left towards the helicopter and you'll come to a room with a set of stairs. 
            Take them up to the roof and eliminate the pilot by the helicopter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Go ahead and plant the first explosive and get ready to do it once more with the other helicopter. After 
            that, head to the other helicopter, back down the stairs, by the ladder you climbed up.
        </p>
        <p>
            You'll come across a set of stairs guarded by two enemies. Take the path to the right of them and you'll 
            end up downstairs. Continue just ahead towards another set of stairs that lead to the opposite side of the 
            enemies from above.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here, you'll be able to line up a shot and take them both out easily.
        </p>
        <img src = "Assets/Picture14.jpg" alt = "Call of Duty" class="center">
        <p>
            Take them out and head up the stairs to the helicopter. You can sneak up and plant the explosives without being 
            seen by the guards nearby. Just watch out for the one patrolling.
        </p>
        <p>
            Plant the explosives, and then run back down to the ground level, towards Farah. Climb the ladder that leads up 
            to where she is and after you walk inside, she'll instruct you to detonate the explosives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Follow her instructions and watch the sparks fly. Once you do that, all chaos will ensue, so you'll be able to use 
            this as a distraction to escape. Wait for the guards below to pass and follow Farah down to the street.
        </p>
        <h1>Escape</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Keep following her and you'll eventually be spotted and be forced to run inside a nearby building. Make your way through 
            the building and then head outside, where you'll need to go prone in the grass to avoid being seen.
        </p>
        <img src = "Assets/Picture15.jpg" alt = "Call of Duty" class="center">
        <p>
            After the guards turn around, take them out and head into the building on the right. Follow Farah through the gap in the wall 
            and keep moving along the path.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wait for the guards to pass and you'll then have to enter a building to climb down a ladder. This will end the mission.
